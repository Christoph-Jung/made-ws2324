# Project Title
Are the infamous NBA 2k ratings matching their stats and salaries

## Project Overview
This project developed for the course Methods of Advanced Data Engineering (MADE) at Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuernberg by the [Professorship of Open-Source Software](https://oss.cs.fau.de) aims to answer the question, if given advanced stats and salaries are NBA players matching their NBA 2k rating published prior to the season.

## Description and Motivation
The NBA is one of the most stats heavy professional sport league in the world. The teams invest highly in analytics and tracking of different metrics, which results in a bunch of different available stats. One fan favorite statistic is the publication of the NBA 2k ratings at the beginning of each season for the eponymous video game. While only relevant for the video game itself, the ratings tend to be heavily discussed by fans and TV. But how accurate are these ratings in hindsight with respect to advanced stats, and to add something extra to this project, to salary. We want to look at the NBA 2k 2020 players stats and analyze them using the stats from the subsequent season.

## Report
The findings and motivation of the project were summarized into a [Project Report](https://github.com/Christoph-Jung/made-ws2324/blob/main/project/report.ipynb), presented as a Jupyter notebook.

## Exercises
During the semester we were asked to complete exercises, they can be found in the `exercises` folder.
