1. Given advanced stats are NBA players worth their salaries with respect to their position and their NBA colleagues.

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
The NBA is one of the most stats heavy professional sport league in the world. The teams invest highly in analytics and tracking of different metrics, which results in a bunch of different available stats. One fan favourite statistic is the publication of the NBA 2k ratings at the beginning of each season for the eponymous video game. While only relevant for the video game itself, the ratings tend to be heavily discussed by fans and TV. But how accurate are these ratings in hindsight with respect to advanced stats, and to add something extra to this project, to salary. We want to look at the NBA 2k 2020 players stats and analyze them using the stats from the subsequent season.
